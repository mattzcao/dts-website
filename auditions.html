							Auditions will be virtual - submit a video by April 21st. Callbacks will be in person.
							Please read the following guidelines carefully.-->

							<!-- <h3 class="section-title black" style="font-size:25px;letter-spacing:0px;margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px;">In-Person Auditions:</h3>
							<p class="section-item-detail">
								1. Fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/izpbZQRwSkt6E2wb6" target="_blank">Google Form</a>.<br>
								2. If you haven’t already, sign up for a <a href="https://www.wejoinin.com/sheets/hbfte" target="_blank">preliminary audition slot</a>. Signups are due by Wednesday, September 7th at 11:59 PM. 
								If there is already a name in your desired slot, feel free to still join the same slot! <br>
								3. Please prepare a short solo (a verse and chorus of any song) for your audition, even if you are auditioning for Vocal Percussion (beatboxer). The audition will be 15-20 minutes in length, and will consist of a vocal warmup, a sight singing excerpt, and your solo.<br>
								4. Come to the basement of Morrison Hall at the time of your audition and wait by the benches next to the front desk!
								<br>
								<u>IF you missed our September 7th deadline, fear not! You can still attend Walk-in Auditions on September 9th.</u><br>
								For Walk-in Auditions: No sign up necessary! Just come to Morrison Basement on Friday, September 9th any time between 10 AM - 7 PM and we'll audition you. Make sure to just prepare a verse and chorus of a solo! </p>

							<!--<p class="section-item-detail" style="text-align:left">
								1. <b>A brief introduction</b>: name, year, major, and anything else you'd like to include to introduce yourself!<br>
								2. <b>Warmups</b>: Download the two following links and sing along to the warmups, going as high and as low as you feel comfortable singing. For the ascending warmups, use the syllable "vee" going up and "vah" going down. For descending warmups, use the syllable "yah". It is okay if you need to skip one or two sequences to find your note.<br>
								<a href="./assets/Warmup-Asc.mp3">Ascending Warmups</a><br>
								<a href="./assets/Warmup-Des.mp3">Descending Warmups</a><br>
								3. <b>Solos</b>: Please prepare <b>TWO</b> short solos (a verse + chorus), <b>without accompaniment</b>, for your audition. Feel free to choose any two songs you feel confident singing.
								<br>
								4. <b>Vocal Percussion</b>: If you are auditioning as vocal percussion, please record yourself singing the warmups and solo like everyone else. Afterwards, please give us a sample of your VP abilities, in any way you see fit! One great way is to pick a couple of percussive sounds you like to use and sample them one at a time, and then use them together to make a beat.
								<br>
								5. Once you've finished recording your audition video, please call it <b>"FirstName-LastName-AUDITION"</b> and email it to cal.drawntoscale@gmail.com with the subject <b>"SP23 AUDITION"</b> by Wednesday, April 21st, 11:59pm.<br>
								6. Lastly, fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVzYTmcATvqphAIwiLniIdRSadwdZK2pG5EcdZ98d0Ajcnig/viewform"><b>Google Form</b></a> and you're all set. <br><br></p>

					<p class="testimonial-detail question-text">
						Q. How do auditions work?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Our audition process comprises a round of preliminary auditions with tests of vocal range, tonal memory, sight singing, and solo ability, and a second round of callbacks. Preliminary auditions last 15-20 minutes. You will be notified a few hours to a few days after your preliminary audition about whether you have made it through to callbacks. Callbacks can take up to the entire day depending upon how many auditionees are called back. However, we do make accommodations for those with time constraints.

				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail question text">
						Q. What do I need to do to prepare for a preliminary audition?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. We strongly recommend that auditionees warmup prior to the preliminary audition, as we will be testing your upper and lower range, and ability to follow our warmup exercise. We expect auditionees to prepare a solo piece between 1-2 minutes long – about the length of a verse and chorus of a pop song.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail question-text">
						Q. But I can’t sight read! What should I do?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Don't worry! We want to see how quickly you can learn music, and one of those methods is sight singing. Some people learn better by reading music, while others learn by ear. Either is fine.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail question-text">
						Q. What should I sing for my audition?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Sing a part of a song that showcases your voice well and you enjoy singing. Also, please make sure the song is in English!
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail question-text">
						Q. But I’m nervous!
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. We know. We understand that the audition process can be a nerve-wracking one. We’ve been there and were probably nervous trainwrecks at our own auditions, so we understand. We’ll try to get you to relax so you can perform to the best of your abilities.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail question-text">
						Q. How do callbacks work?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. If you are given a callback, congratulations! You will be given 1-2 short pieces to learn. The purpose of this is to see how well your voice is able to blend with the current group. You will also be asked to perform your solo piece again, along with some of the exercises from the preliminary audition individually in front of all of the members of the current group.
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail question-text">
						Q. What are the time commitments involved?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Our rehearsals are Sundays and Wednesdays 6-9 pm, apart from weekly one-hour sectionals. We also have weekly Sproul performances on Friday at noon, with warmups beginning at 11 am. We also have other events during the semester as well as a concert near the end of each semester. We expect members to be able to make all rehearsals and Sproul performances, and a number of other events. Being a member of an a cappella group could be a significant time commitment, but we enjoy every moment spent together as a performance group!
					</div>
				</div> <!-- /.item -->
				<div class="item">
					<p class="testimonial-detail question-text">
						Q. Should I audition again if I have auditioned previously?
					</p>
					<div class="test-name">
						A. Definitely! Selections at the preliminary and the callback levels are always very difficult for us due to our limited time and the number of voices per part we need changes from semester to semester. We have seen many wonderful singers who showed great promise and simply needed a little bit more experience. Some of our members have also auditioned multiple times before getting into the group, so don’t be afraid to re-audition.
